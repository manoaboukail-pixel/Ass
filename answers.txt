1) fork() Program Explanation
The program uses the fork() system call to create a new process.  
After fork() is called, the program splits into two processes:
- The child process (fork returns 0)
- The parent process (fork returns the PID of the child)

Each process prints its own message to show that both are running separately.



2) Starting a Process in the Background
Using: sleep 300 &
This runs the process in the background so the terminal stays free.
The command "jobs" shows the background processes.



3) Stopping a Process
I use:
ps aux | grep sleep  
to find the PID of the sleep process.

Then I stop it using:
kill <PID>

I run the grep command again to confirm it is stopped.


4) Pausing and Resuming a Process
To pause:
kill -STOP <PID>

To resume:
kill -CONT <PID>

This stops the process without killing it.


5) The Job of the Linker
The linker combines multiple object files into one executable file.
In the example:
- file1.c contains the function hello()
- file2.c contains main() and calls hello()
The linker connects both files so the final program can run.



6) The Job of the Loader
The loader runs when I execute the program.  
It loads the program into memory and loads the shared libraries it needs.

Using:
ldd simple_program
I can see which shared libraries the program uses at runtime.



7) Makefile
The Makefile compiles:
- process_creation.c
- file1.c + file2.c (output_program)
- simple_program.c

It also includes a clean rule to remove the executables.
